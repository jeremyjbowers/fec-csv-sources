# fec-csv-sources

Slighly modified CSV headers and column names derived from [the New York Times's Fech project.](https://github.com/dwillis/fech-sources)

From the [fech-sources](https://github.com/dwillis/fech-sources) repository's README:

"This collection of comma-delimited files is meant to be included in Fech, a Ruby library for parsing F.E.C. electronic filings, or in similar libraries. The files contained within are the same files in the sources directory in earlier version of Fech itself. They have been moved to a separate repository so that it's not necessary to release a new version of the gem each time the F.E.C. updates its filing formats, and also to eliminate the need for non-Ruby libraries to create and maintain their own collections of CSVs."
